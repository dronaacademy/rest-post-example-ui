## Rest POST Example UI

This project acts as a front-end to the rest-post-example project implemented in spring boot. This project demonstrates two important concepts related to angular applications:
* Angular forms
* Angular tables to show data fetched from REST web services

The application simply presents a form through which book details can be submitted to the database and can be seen in a tabular format.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (npm)
* Anguular (ng)
* The rest-post-example application (https://github.com/dronaacademy/rest-post-example) running in port 8080

### Build and execution instructions
```
npm install
ng serve --open
```
